# Fulfill - Todo list management web application

Sample app I built in a day as part of an interview. Rails 4.1.0.beta1, devise, Backbone v1.1.0.

## Done

* I can have my todo list displayed.
* Assign priorities and due dates to the entries.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
* Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger
  actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).
* I can create users in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.
* I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).
* I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
  not an option.
* I can mark an entry as completed.
* I can sort my entry lists using due_date and priority.


## To-do

* You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
